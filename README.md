# Version 1.1R - Completed Command 1

> This version currently supports the following functionality:
>
>    - The use of 'x' to exit the program, upon input from the user  
>    - Searching for exact search terms in the database works correctly  
>    - Statistics are accurately outputted to the user prior to the first command prompt

------
# Changelog:

>    - Added functionality to support partial input searches, so searching something like
>       "O'Hare" would work.  Naturally, anything that has that term in it will also be shown,
>       but this works as intended right now.  [Ex: Searching "O'Hare" would get you several
>       stations that stop at O'Hare, even if you only wanted "O'Hare Airport" specifically.]
>
>    -  **Final Update For Command 1**

------

# Planned Functionality:

> The next version will focus on:
>
>   - Adding functionality for **command 2**, specifically:  
      ```Given a station name, find the percentage of riders on weekdays, on Saturdays, and on
         Sundays/holidays for that station. The station name from the user should be an exact 
         match. Each percentage should be calculated out of the total number of riders for that 
         station. Display both the totals and the percentages```
